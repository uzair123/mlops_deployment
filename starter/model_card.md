Model Details

    Model Type: Random Forest Classifier
    Task: Binary classification (predicting salary labels: e.g., ">50K" or "<=50K")

Intended Use

This model is intended for use in applications that predict whether an individual's salary exceeds $50,000 based on various demographic and employment-related features. It can be used in tools for career advice, salary estimation, or demographic analysis.
Training Data

    Features: The model was trained on features such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, and native country.
    Data Preprocessing: The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and standardize numerical values.

Evaluation Data

    Source: test data which was not used for training
    Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training and evaluation sets, with [insert percentage or method used, e.g., 80/20 split].

Metrics

Precision: 0.7250187828700225, Recall: 0.619781631342325, Fbeta: 0.6682825484764543

Ethical Considerations

    Bias: The model may reflect biases present in the training data, including socio-economic disparities, which could affect the fairness of predictions.
    Impact: Predictions may influence decisions related to hiring or salary offers, so careful consideration is needed to avoid reinforcing stereotypes.

Caveats and Recommendations

    Limitations: The model's performance may degrade on unseen data or in different demographic contexts. It should not be used as the sole basis for critical decisions.
    Continuous Monitoring: Regularly evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on new data to ensure its relevance and accuracy.
    User Awareness: Inform users about potential biases and limitations when using the model.
